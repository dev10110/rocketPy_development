# rocketPy
A Pythonic implementation of openRocket and CambridgeRocket

Uses the mathematics described in
1. [OpenRocket Technical Documentation](http://openrocket.info/documentation.html)
2. [CambridgeRocket Aeroforce Estimation](http://cambridgerocket.sourceforge.net/AerodynamicCoefficients.pdf)
3. [CambridgeRocket Simulation](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29AS.1943-5525.0000051)

Attempts to be useful to hobbyists trying to design and simulate their rockets, especially if control laws are added into the mix.
